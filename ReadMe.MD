# EE Calculator
This app is a work in progress and is for electrical and electronics engineers. Here are some ideas of what I want it to contain:
- Calculate current limiting resistor value
- Calculate cutoff frequency, or resistance/capacitance/inductance required for desired cutoff frequency. I.e. RC, RL, RLC circuit solver in time and frequency domains.
- Calculate op-amp gains, slew rates, bandwidth, etc
- Transistor amplifier scenarios (e.g. common collector, common emitter, etc) with calculations for DC bias, q-point, etc
- Characteristic impedance calculator for tracks and coax cables
- Links to resources
- Pinout and terminal types .pdf files


This app is being made during my spare time. Thank you for inspecting!
