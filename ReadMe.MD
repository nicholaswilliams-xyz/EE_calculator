# EE Calculator
This app is a work in progress and is for electrical and electronics engineers:
- Calculate current limiting resistor value
- Calculate cutoff frequency, or resistance/capacitance/inductance required for desired cutoff frequency
- Calculate op-amp gains, slew rates, bandwidth, etc
- Characteristic impedance calculator for tracks and coax cables
- Links to resources
- Pinout and terminal types .pdf files


This app is being made during my spare time. Thank you for inspecting!
